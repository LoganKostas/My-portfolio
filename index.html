                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <strong><small>My name is Logan, i'm 22 years old and this is my first experience in doing anything related to coding.
                    I was previously persuing my degree in electrical engineering, but after being in the electrical field for a couple years I realized it wasn't for me.

                <h1>My interests</h1>
                <strong><large>I love traveling, the only place i've been out of the country so far is Colombia but i'm hoping to be able to go and explore alot more.
                    I enjoy going out of state and visiting the different aquariums. My favorite so far has been the Denver Aquarium. I spend alot of my time playing diferent
                     games and my favorite right now is elden ring.

                <h1>Why Coding?</h1>
                <strong>My initial thought with coding was that it seemed like an approtunity to start a career that offers alot of opprotunity for advancement. 
                    I have some friends that are involved in coding jobs and the more I talked to them about their jobs and got to see a little more about what they do it became an option 
                    that became very interesting to me. I would hate to have a career in something that I find boring. I feel like coding has so much to offer that i could never get bored. I like the challenge
                    of it so far.
